- correlation: Correlation matrices of the different measures of relative stability 
- RS_data_0.01.tsv: Raw data of the relative stability measures for each pair of fixed points at 1\% noise using 'exact' MFPT computations (for the cumulative case and for all models of this ensemble)
- RS_data_1_0.01.tsv: Raw data of the relative stability measures for each pair of fixed points at 1\% noise using 'exact' MFPT computations (for the pairwise case and for all models of this ensemble; pair '1' of 6 possible pairs)
